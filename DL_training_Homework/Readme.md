## ConvNet Pytorch example

The accuracy of the model achieved was 98.58%

## He Initialization 

After applying He initialization, the accuracy of the model achieved was 99.13%

## Nadam Otimizer

After using Nadam Optimizer, the accuracy of the model achieved was 98.9%

## Using both He Initialization and Nadam Otimizer

The accuracy of the model achieved was 99.03%

From the above achieved accuracies, by applying He initialization which is weight initialization to the Deep Learning Convnet for MNIST dataset showed the model achieving higher accuracy of 99.13%.
